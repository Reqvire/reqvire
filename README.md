## What is Reqvire?

**Reqvire** transforms how engineering teams manage requirements by bringing them into the **Git workflow** with **AI-native** markdown documents. No more requirements living in separate tools‚Äîeverything lives alongside your code with full version control, automated traceability, and seamless CI/CD integration.

```bash
# Requirements as Code - it's that simple
reqvire validate
reqvire generate-diagrams
reqvire change-impact --git-commit=HEAD~1
```

### **Requirements as Code**
Write requirements in **structured Markdown** that's both human-readable and AI-friendly. Version control everything with Git.

### **AI-First Engineering**  
Built from day one for **Large Language Models**. Your requirements become the perfect context for AI-assisted development.

### **Automated Traceability**
Every requirement automatically traces to code, tests, and architecture. Change impact analysis with every commit.

### **Zero Context Switch**
Requirements, code, and documentation in one repository. Review requirement changes like code changes.

     ```

2. **Clone the reqvire Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Reqvire/reqvire.git
   cd reqvire
   ```

3. **Build reqvire**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Install the Binary** (optional)
   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```
   This will install the binary to `~/.cargo/bin/reqvire`

#### Using Pre-built Binaries

4. **Verify the Installation**
   ```bash
   reqvire --version
   ```
    
### Configuration

Create `reqvire.yaml` in the root of the git repo with following minimal content:
```
paths:

  # Path to the user requirements root folder
  user_requirements_root_folder: "specifications"
  
  # Glob patterns to exclude from requirements processing
  excluded_filename_patterns:
    - "Usecases.md"
    - "**/Logical*.md"
    - "**/Physical*.md"
    - "**/TODO.md"

### Contribution Discipline

To maintain **consistency**, **traceability**, and **quality** in **Reqvire**, we follow a strict **contribution discipline** that ensures the system model, tests, and verifications evolve alongside the code.

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Read the Contribution Guidelines**:
   - Begin by reviewing our [Contribution Guidelines](./doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on processes, coding standards, and expectations.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Create your own copy of the repository by forking it.

3. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Work on your changes in a dedicated branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Maintain Requirements, Tests, and Verifications**:
   - **Update or create requirements**:
     - For any **new code**, **feature**, or **change** in the codebase, always **create new requirements** or **update existing ones** to reflect those changes.
     - Requirements should be added in the appropriate **User Requirements** or **System Requirements** folders.
     - Requirments must be approved before code can be implemented or existing functionality changed
   - **Update verifications**:
     - For every **new requirement** or **E2E test**, create or update the corresponding **verification cases** in the `specifications/verifications/` directory.
     - Verifications ensure that **requirements** are linked to **tests**, and all features are properly validated.     
   - **Add or update end-to-end (E2E) tests**:
     - If your changes introduce **new functionality** or modify existing behavior that is not covered by tests, ensure to **add E2E tests** in the `tests/` directory.
     - Tests must validate the **expected behavior** of your feature or change.
5. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Run **reqvire validation** locally to ensure your requirements and verifications are consistent:
     ```bash
     reqvire --validate
     ```
   - Ensure that your code passes **all tests** and that **no existing functionality breaks**.

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request with a **clear and detailed description** of what you've implemented or fixed.
   - Include a summary of:
     - **Change impact report if requirements were updated**
     - **New or updated tests**
     - **New or updated verifications**

7. **Collaborate and Iterate**:
   - Engage with maintainers, respond to feedback, and collaborate to refine your PR until it's ready to be merged.

For more details, refer to the [Contributing Guide](./doc/CONTRIBUTING.md).
