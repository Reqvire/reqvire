# ReqFlow

**ReqFlow** is a comprehensive **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** framework that combines a **methodology**, a **toolset**, and a **language** to streamline the management of system requirements and models. Designed to integrate seamlessly with modern Git workflows, ReqFlow simplifies MBSE by leveraging Markdown-based artifacts and automation, making it accessible to engineers, developers, and product managers alike.


## Why ReqFlow?

- **A Unified Framework**: Combines methodology, tools, and language into a MBSE solution.
- **Git-Centric**: Built around Git workflows, enabling integration with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Lightweight & Accessible**: Uses Markdown for requirements and models, ensuring readability and ease of use.
- **Methodology**: Follows ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 principles, tailored to software product development and agile workflows.
- **Toolset**: Automates traceability, validation, and diagram generation, integrating seamlessly with version control.
- **Language**: Inspired by SysML but optimized for Markdown and Mermaid, ensuring compatibility with modern AI tools.

### ReqFlow as a tool

ReqFlow is a requirements management tool designed to integrate directly into Git workflows. It uses a file-based approach where requirements are stored in markdown files within the project repository. This allows teams to manage requirements alongside their code, using familiar Git processes.

### ReqFlow as a language

ReqFlow is inspired by SysML and systems engineering practices but focuses on a subset of these methodologies. The goal is to simplify requirements management and make it easier for programmers, product managers, and tech companies—especially those working on software, cloud, and tech products—to adopt. By narrowing the scope, ReqFlow ensures a balance between powerful features and ease of use.

ReqFlow is opinionated, requiring semi-structured markdown files that follow specific conventions. These rules enable automation such as generating diagrams, creating traceability matrices, and linking requirements to tasks, issues, pull requests, and test cases.
