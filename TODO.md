## Filter per element command


Also would be interesting to add: 
 *  --filter-content-by-similar='This will be embed and vector searched' 
 
Fast cpu rust sentence embedding implementation:
* https://github.com/kampersanda/sif-embedding

```

```

## Filter non verified requirements

Find not verified requirements 
 * reqvire --traces | grep -A 2 "❌" | 
 * could  be part of filter on traces level
