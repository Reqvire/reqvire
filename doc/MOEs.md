# Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) and Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for Stakeholder Requirements

The **Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs)** and **Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)** in this document are tailored to evaluate how well the system meets **stakeholder requirements**. These metrics focus on outcomes that align with stakeholder goals, such as user satisfaction, operational efficiency, and business impact, rather than the technical specifications of the system itself.

## Key Performance Parameters (KPPs)

KPPs for stakeholder requirements define **critical thresholds** for performance that directly impact stakeholder goals. They represent non-negotiable metrics that ensure the system delivers on the value and benefits promised to its stakeholders.

### Examples:
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Minimum satisfaction score required to meet stakeholder expectations.
- **Adoption Rate**: Minimum percentage of stakeholders adopting new features or services.
- **Operational Cost Efficiency**: Threshold for cost savings while maintaining service quality.
- **Mission Success Rate**: The percentage of completed missions or use cases that align with stakeholder goals.

KPPs for stakeholder requirements emphasize results that stakeholders care about, ensuring that their expectations are met or exceeded.

## Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs)

MOEs for stakeholder requirements evaluate how well the system achieves **outcomes and value** from a stakeholder perspective. These metrics focus on operational and experiential aspects, ensuring the system delivers the desired benefits.

### Examples of MOEs


#### MOE_CR: Maintain High Customer Retention
- **Goal**: Minimize churn and retain stakeholders through enhanced value delivery.
- **Metric**: Churn Rate (CR)
- **Metric Calculation**:  
  > CR = (Number of churned stakeholders in a time window / Total active stakeholders at the start of the time window) × 100.
- **Target Period**: 1 year
- **Target Window**: Use monthly churn rates, averaged over the target period.
- **Target Statement**: Reduce churn rate by X% over the 1-year period.
- **Objective**: Build long-term relationships with stakeholders by consistently meeting their expectations.

---

#### MOE_OPE: Increase Operational Efficiency for Stakeholders
- **Goal**: Streamline stakeholder operations by reducing inefficiencies in workflows.
- **Metric**: Operational Process Efficiency (OPE)
- **Metric Calculation**:  
  > OPE = (Total stakeholder output generated / Total resources consumed during the time window) × 100.
- **Target Period**: 6 months
- **Target Window**: Monthly calculations averaged over the target period.
- **Target Statement**: Improve OPE by X% over the 6-month period.
- **Objective**: Deliver tools and features that enable stakeholders to achieve more with fewer resources.

---

#### MOE_MDAU: Increase Stakeholder Engagement
- **Goal**: Foster higher engagement with the system from stakeholders.
- **Metric**: Monthly Daily Active Users (MDAU)
- **Metric Calculation**:  
  > MDAU = (Sum of unique daily active users in a month) / (Number of days in the month).
- **Target Period**: 1 year
- **Target Window**: Monthly values averaged over the 1-year target period.
- **Target Statement**: Achieve an increase in MDAU by X% over the period.
- **Objective**: Encourage stakeholders to interact with the system regularly through improved usability and features.

---

#### MOE_AVA: Ensure High Availability for Stakeholders
- **Goal**: Provide uninterrupted access to stakeholders to meet operational needs.
- **Metric**: System Availability (AVA)
- **Metric Calculation**:  
  > AVA = ((Total uptime during the time window) / (Total time in the time window)) × 100.
- **Target Period**: 1 year
- **Target Window**: Monthly availability percentages, averaged over the 1-year period.
- **Target Statement**: Maintain AVA at or above 99.9% over the 1-year period.
- **Objective**: Deliver a reliable system for stakeholders, minimizing disruptions to their workflows.

### Relationship Between MOEs and KPPs for Stakeholder Requirements

- **KPPs**: Represent critical performance thresholds directly tied to stakeholder success and satisfaction.
- **MOEs**: Evaluate broader outcomes, focusing on how effectively the system supports stakeholder goals and operational impact.

Together, MOEs and KPPs for stakeholder requirements ensure the system delivers value, aligns with stakeholder expectations, and achieves intended outcomes.
