# Usecases

Use cases define the key interactions between the system and its users, external systems, or other stakeholders. They describe the functional behavior of the system at a high level, capturing how the system fulfills its intended purpose and aligns with stakeholder expectations. By detailing these interactions, use cases serve as a bridge between stakeholder needs and the technical design, ensuring the system is built to achieve its goals.

Use cases not only provide a structured way to capture functional requirements but also:
- **Clarify the System's Scope**: By identifying actors, their goals, and the system's boundaries, use cases ensure clarity about what the system will and will not do.
- **Facilitate Communication**: They act as a common language between technical teams, stakeholders, and users.
- **Support Traceability**: Use cases link high-level requirements to specific system functionalities, helping ensure all requirements are addressed during development.
- **Guide Validation and Verification**: They provide a baseline for testing, ensuring that implemented functionalities align with stakeholder goals.

By systematically capturing these interactions, use cases ensure the system is designed and implemented with a clear understanding of its intended functions and external interactions.

## Usecase diagrams

In SysML (Systems Modeling Language), use case diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram used to describe the high-level functional interactions between a system and its external environment. 
They help in identifying the goals of the system and the functionality it must support.

### Purpose in SysML
1. **Define functional boundaries**: Helps to understand and clarify the scope of the system.
2. **Capture stakeholder needs**: Represents what the system must achieve from an external perspective.

To be able to render usecase diargams in mermaid as part of markdown document, mermaid's flowchart diagram is used instead.
