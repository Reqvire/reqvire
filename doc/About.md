# Reqvire: Git-Native and AI-Enabled Modeling & Requirements Tool

## Overview

**Reqvire** is a lightweight, Git-native tool for managing **requirements**, **system specifications**, and **architecture models** using structured **Markdown files**. It is designed to work seamlessly with tools like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, making it a natural fit for modern software and systems engineering teams.

Reqvire enables:
- Managing requirements and architecture using version-controlled, human-readable Markdown.
- Automated generation of **diagrams**, **traceability matrices**, and **impact reports** from semi-structured content.
- Seamless integration into developer workflows via **Git branches**, **pull requests**, and **CI automation**.
- **AI-friendly** formatting that enables analysis, validation, and augmentation by large language models.

## Reqvire Modeling Language

Reqvire uses a lightweight, opinionated modeling language based on **semi-structured Markdown**. This format is readable by both humans and machines, enabling automation, visualization, and AI integration — all without requiring proprietary modeling environments.

### Key Elements

Each Reqvire model is made up of Markdown files and elements representing:

- **Requirements** – User needs, constraints, and system-level behaviors.
- **System Structure** – Components, modules, and their interconnections.
- **Behaviors** – States, flows, and operations.
- **Traceability Links** – Relations between requirements, architecture, and test cases.
- **Verification Definitions** – Mappings between requirements and their validation/test strategies.

These documents are written using simple conventions, headers, and embedded tags, allowing automated tools to extract structure and meaning.

## Diagram & Traceability Automation

Reqvire tooling automatically parses structured Markdown to generate:

- **Architecture diagrams** (component hierarchies, interfaces, dependencies)
- **Traceability matrices** linking requirements to architecture, verifications, and tests
- **Impact reports** showing what was changed, and what it affects

These outputs are generated using **MermaidJS** and custom Reqvire tooling. Diagrams are clickable, allowing users to navigate directly to relevant Markdown files in the repo.

Diagram generation is deterministic and scriptable — ideal for integrating into CI/CD workflows and pull request reviews.

## CI/CD Integration

Reqvire is designed for automation. In typical Git-based workflows, you can:

- **Validate Markdown structure** using static checks
- **Auto-generate diagrams** during CI builds or PRs
- **Generate traceability and change impact reports** for stakeholder review
- **Block PRs** if requirements are incomplete or broken
- **Package models** into versioned documentation releases


## AI Compatibility

Reqvire is built to be **AI-friendly from the ground up**. Its use of **structured Markdown** with clearly defined sections, headings, metadata, and conventions makes it ideal for use with modern **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and other AI systems.

Because models are written in plain text with predictable patterns, AI tools can easily:
- Parse and understand system models
- Analyze relationships between artifacts
- Generate meaningful suggestions or summaries
- Validate consistency and completeness across the model

### Example AI Use Cases

#### 1. Requirement Analysis
LLMs can analyze Markdown-based requirements to:
- Identify missing or ambiguous elements
- Suggest clearer phrasing
- Propose edge cases or constraints
- Generate acceptance criteria or verification steps

#### 2. Architecture Suggestion
By understanding the relationships in architecture files and diagrams, AI can:
- Detect inconsistent component relationships
- Propose modular design improvements
- Suggest missing interfaces or dependencies

#### 3. Traceability & Impact Prediction
AI tools can:
- Automatically trace which tests or requirements are impacted by a change
- Flag areas that may be affected downstream (e.g., architecture, code, test coverage)
- Summarize model diffs for engineers or product teams

#### 4. Test Coverage Assistance
Based on requirements and use cases, AI can:
- Recommend missing test scenarios
- Generate test case outlines
- Flag requirements that are unverified or untested

#### 5. Report Generation
AI can automatically:
- Generate traceability reports
- Summarize system architecture
- Prepare documentation for releases or reviews

### Why Markdown Matters

By sticking to a semi-structured Markdown format:
- AI tools don’t need complex parsers or DSL interpreters
- Models can be used as-is by LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or private copilots
- Validation and generation become trivial to automate

This makes Reqvire models not only powerful for humans but **highly interoperable with AI systems**, whether embedded in CI/CD, editors, or code review bots.

## AI-Assisted Implementation with Human Oversight

Reqvire is designed not only to enable AI understanding of systems models — but to **actively support AI agents and developer tools in implementing code that aligns with those models**.

Because the entire system — from high-level requirements to detailed architecture and verification criteria — is written in structured, human-readable Markdown, AI tools can:

- Follow specifications and design constraints
- Understand traceability between features, components, and test cases
- Help generate consistent, aligned code that matches the system intent
- Use verification definitions to check or test the implementation

### How AI Agents Benefit

- **Context-Aware Generation**: With Reqvire’s traceability structure, AI tools can understand the "why" behind every component or function.
- **Specification-Driven Coding**: Agents can generate code directly tied to specific requirements, reducing guesswork or misinterpretation.
- **Verification-Backed Validation**: LLMs or code agents can refer to defined verifications to ensure the implementation meets intended behavior.
- **Trace-Based Refactoring**: When requirements change, AI agents can assist in propagating those changes through the codebase and related artifacts.

### Human in Control — Always

While Reqvire empowers AI tools to act as smart collaborators, the **human engineer remains the system’s captain** — setting direction, making decisions, and approving outcomes.

Reqvire ensures that:
- Every AI-suggested change is traceable and reviewable
- System evolution remains understandable and documented
- AI tooling acts in service of the engineer’s intent, not in place of it

This approach enables a **productive partnership** between human creativity and machine precision, unlocking new levels of engineering productivity while maintaining trust, traceability, and control.
