# Design Specification Documents (DSDs)

High-level documents that outline the system design to ensure alignment with requirements and constraints. These documents focus on guiding architecture and implementation by detailing specifications that must satisfy certain requirements. They typically avoid going into subsystem-specific implementation details, as those are managed in implementation repositories and are not part of the ReqFlow model. Instead, ReqFlow DSDs concentrate on constraints, product-related details, and overarching guidance for architecture and implementation specs.
