# BlackBox.md - Iterative Refinement Process

## Overview

The Black Box process in systems engineering focuses on defining and refining system behaviors and interfaces without delving into internal implementation details. This approach emphasizes **what** the system should do (externally visible behavior), rather than **how** it does it (internal mechanisms), allowing stakeholder requirements and system boundaries to be clearly established before technical decisions are made.

This iterative refinement process progressively elaborates the system model from abstract stakeholder needs down to concrete, structured system architectures and requirements.

## Iterative Refinement Process

- Usecase diagram:  
  Represents external interactions between actors (users, external systems) and the system. The diagram defines the system boundary, showing what the system does from an external point of view, independent of internal structures. It helps identify high-level operational scenarios and functional expectations.

- User and mission requirements:  
  Derived from stakeholders, customers, and operational context. These are typically high-level, solution-independent statements defining **what** the system must achieve to fulfill its intended purpose and mission. They form the foundation for further modeling and refinement.

- Logical Architecture:  
  Created during the conceptual design phase. It captures the high-level functional organization of the system, including the main functions and their relationships. This architecture abstracts away technical implementation details, focusing instead on **how** the system will achieve the mission requirements from a functional standpoint. It ensures coverage and traceability to user and mission needs, promoting early validation of the system's conceptual design.

- Physical Architecture:  
  Refines the logical architecture by mapping functions to tangible system components, subsystems, and services. It incorporates technical, operational, and physical constraints, addressing **how** the system will be implemented. This step introduces specific technologies, interfaces, and performance characteristics, ensuring the design is feasible and aligned with project constraints.

- System Requirements:  
  Decomposed and derived from user, mission, and functional (logical) needs, and further refined based on the physical architecture. These requirements describe detailed specifications for systems and subsystems, ensuring that each part of the system meets performance, interface, and regulatory expectations.  
  Requirements are organized hierarchically, typically in folders that correspond to the systems and subsystems defined in the physical architecture. This structure maintains traceability across different abstraction levels, from stakeholder needs to system design.

## Key Principles

- **Black-box abstraction**:  
  The system is initially viewed as a black box, focusing on externally visible behaviors and interfaces. This abstraction supports stakeholder alignment and requirement elicitation without pre-empting technical solutions.

- **Iterative refinement**:  
  The process is cyclic, allowing progressive validation and refinement of models and requirements. Each iteration provides feedback loops between architecture levels, ensuring consistency and alignment with stakeholder expectations.

- **Traceability**:  
  Every element in the model (use cases, requirements, functions, components) maintains traceability links, enabling impact analysis, validation, and verification throughout the lifecycle.

- **Separation of concerns**:  
  Logical and physical architectures are developed separately, allowing functional needs to be validated independently from technical constraints before committing to a specific implementation.

## Outcomes

By following the Black Box iterative refinement process, the system model evolves from abstract stakeholder needs to a well-structured set of architectures and requirements, supporting robust design, validation, and verification activities. This approach reduces risks, improves stakeholder communication, and ensures system feasibility within operational and technical constraints.
