# Verifications in Reqvire

## Conceptual Overview

In Reqvire, **verification** is the process of confirming that a system or its components meet specified **requirements**. Verification ensures that the system has been **built right**, checking whether it conforms to the defined functional and non-functional requirements at each level of system decomposition.

Verification activities are integrated into the **requirements structure**, maintaining clear **traceability** between requirements and their associated **verification methods** and **test artifacts**.

Reqvire supports various **verification methods**, including:

- **Inspection**: Visual examination or manual review of deliverables.
- **Analysis**: Evaluation using models, simulations, or analytical techniques.
- **Demonstration**: Showing that a function operates as intended under specific conditions.
- **Test**: Execution of the system or subsystem under controlled conditions to verify compliance.

Reqvire encourages documenting **verification cases** and linking them directly to **requirements**, ensuring that every requirement is verified through an appropriate method.
