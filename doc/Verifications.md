# Verifications in Reqvire

## Conceptual Overview

In Reqvire, **verification** is the process of confirming that a system or its components meet specified **requirements**. Verification ensures that the system has been **built right**, checking whether it conforms to the defined functional and non-functional requirements at each level of system decomposition.

Verification activities are integrated into the **requirements structure**, maintaining clear **traceability** between requirements and their associated **verification methods** and **test artifacts**.

Reqvire supports various **verification methods**, including:

- **Inspection**: Visual examination or manual review of deliverables.
- **Analysis**: Evaluation using models, simulations, or analytical techniques.
- **Demonstration**: Showing that a function operates as intended under specific conditions.
- **Test**: Execution of the system or subsystem under controlled conditions to verify compliance.

Reqvire encourages documenting **verification cases** and linking them directly to **requirements**, ensuring that every requirement is verified through an appropriate method.

## Verification Types in Reqvire

Reqvire categorizes verification into two primary levels:

- **System-level Verification**:  
  Verifies that the integrated system meets **user** and **mission requirements**. This includes end-to-end testing, integration testing, and validation against stakeholder expectations.

- **Subsystem/Component-level Verification**:  
  Verifies that individual **system requirements** and **subsystems** meet their specifications. This includes unit tests, component-level analysis, and hardware/software integration tests.

Both levels ensure **progressive verification** throughout the system development lifecycle.
