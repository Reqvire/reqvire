# User Stories

Each user story represents a high-level user need and is linked to specific measures of effectiveness (MOEs). User requirements refine user stories into actionable, detailed system requirements.

User stories are a key part of the user needs definition process and follow the definition of use cases. They serve as an entry point for defining user requirements, which refine user stories and group them into structures that facilitate the development of logical architecture diagrams.

A **user story** relates to a specific MOE with the `traced` relation.

User stories follow the same format as requirements; the only difference lies in the writing style.
