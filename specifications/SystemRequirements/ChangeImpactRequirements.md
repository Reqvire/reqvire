### Change Impact Detection Algorithm

The system shall implement a requirement change detection algorithm that identifies changes between versions of the model and determines their impact through relationship traversal.

#### Details

The algorithm shall consist of the following steps:

1. **Diff Analysis**:
   - Compare the current state of a requirement with its previous state
   - Identify structural changes (additions, deletions, modifications)
   - Generate a ChangeSet representing all detected changes
   - Associate changes with specific elements in the model

2. **Impact Determination**:
   - For each changed element, identify all relations from the element
   - Apply relation-specific propagation rules as defined in RelationTypesRegistry.md
   - Consider the relation direction and change impact direction for each relation
   - Build an impact tree representing the propagation of changes

3. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Perform a depth-first traversal of relationships
   - Create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of change impact
   - Handle circular dependencies by preventing infinite recursion
   - Track visited nodes to prevent duplicate processing

4. **Impact Classification**:
   - Assign impact severity levels based on relation types
   - Classify changes as:
     - Direct: Changes to the element itself
     - Indirect: Changes propagated from related elements
     - Potential: Changes that might affect an element based on semantic analysis
   - Calculate aggregated impact scores for each affected element

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching of traversal results
   - Use parallel processing for independent branches of the impact tree
   - Apply pruning techniques to limit traversal depth when appropriate
   - Support incremental impact analysis for large models

### Change Impact Visualization

The system shall provide visual representations of change impact to help users understand the scope and implications of changes.

#### Details

The visualization shall include:

1. **Tree View**:
   - Display a hierarchical tree of affected elements
   - Group elements by impact type (direct, indirect, potential)
   - Show relation types between elements
   - Support collapsing/expanding nodes for better navigation

2. **Color Coding**:
   - Use consistent color scheme for impact types:
     - Direct impacts: Red
     - Indirect impacts: Yellow
     - Potential impacts: Blue
   - Indicate relation types with different line styles
   - Highlight newly introduced or removed relationships

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Allow clicking on elements to focus the view
   - Provide filtering options for relation types
   - Support search functionality within impact results
   - Enable toggling between different visualization modes

4. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Display counts of affected elements by type
   - Show metrics for impact breadth and depth
   - Calculate change propagation fan-out metrics
   - Generate overall change impact assessment

### Change Impact Command Line Interface

The system shall provide a command-line interface for initiating change impact analysis and controlling output formats.

#### Details

The CLI shall support the following functionality:

1. **Analysis Invocation**:
   - Support analyzing changes between git commits
   - Enable specifying elements to analyze by ID or pattern
   - Allow limiting analysis to specific relation types
   - Support depth limitations for large models

2. **Output Formats**:
   - Generate formatted text reports
   - Produce JSON-structured impact data
   - Create Mermaid diagrams of impact trees
   - Integrate with HTML report generation

3. **Filtering Options**:
   - Filter by element types (requirement, verification, etc.)
   - Filter by relation types
   - Filter by impact severity
   - Support inclusion/exclusion patterns

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Support integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - Enable calling from external systems via API
   - Support webhook triggers for automated analysis
   - Allow scripting of analysis operations

### Relation Type Impact Tests

The system shall include comprehensive test cases that verify proper change propagation for each relation type.

#### Details

Tests shall verify:

1. **Parent-Child Relations**:
   - Changes to parent requirements propagate to children
   - Changes to containment structures reflect correctly
   - Derived requirement changes follow specified patterns

2. **Verification Invalidation**:
   - Changes to requirements invalidate verification tests
   - Verification status updates correctly after changes
   - Verification artifacts receive proper notification

3. **Implementation Impact**:
   - Changes to requirements propagate to implementations
   - Implementation components respond correctly to changes
   - Satisfaction relations handle change propagation

4. **Circular Dependency Handling**:
   - Circular requirement dependencies are handled gracefully
   - No infinite loops occur in impact analysis
   - Clear reporting of circular dependency patterns
