# System Requirements

### External Folders Support

The system shall support processing requirements stored in external folders outside the main specifications directory structure, treating them as system requirements in diagram generation and validation.

  * satisfiedBy: [DesignSpecifications/DSD_ExternalFolders.md](../DesignSpecifications/DSD_ExternalFolders.html)

---

### Unified System Requirements Processing

The system shall process all requirements in specifications subfolders (except design specifications) and external folders consistently as system requirements, without requiring a specific SystemRequirements folder.

  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Support for Distributed Requirements](../UserRequirements.html#support-for-distributed-requirements)
  * satisfiedBy: [DesignSpecifications/DSD_ExternalFolders.md](../DesignSpecifications/DSD_ExternalFolders.html)

---

### Element Type and Metadata Support

The system shall support defining element types (requirement, verification, or other custom types) through metadata sections within elements, allowing for flexible organization and explicit type definition.

#### Metadata
* type: requirement

  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Model Linting](UserRequirements.html#model-linting)
  * satisfiedBy: [DesignSpecifications/DSD_ElementTypeAndMetadata.md](../DesignSpecifications/DSD_ElementTypeAndMetadata.html)

---

### Initialization Command

The system shall implement an `init` command that bootstraps a basic ReqFlow project structure with example requirements, folder hierarchy, and a configuration file.

#### Metadata
* type: requirement

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Bootstrap model struture](UserRequirements.html#bootstrap-model-struture)

---

### Initialization Command Configuration Check

The system shall prevent the initialization command from modifying an existing project by detecting if a configuration file already exists (in any of its accepted formats: .yaml, .yml) and report an error instead of proceeding.

#### Metadata
* type: requirement

#### Relations
  * refine: [Initialization Command](#initialization-command)

---

### Index Generator Implementation

The system shall implement an IndexGenerator component that traverses the specifications directory structure and creates a hierarchical index.md file with links and summaries.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Generate Documentation Index](UserRequirements.html#generate-documentation-index)

---

### Directory Structure Processing

The system shall parse the specifications directory structure using the configured paths from reqflow.yaml to identify documentation files and their hierarchical relationships.

#### Relations
  * containedBy: [Index Generator Implementation](#index-generator-implementation)

---

### Markdown Content Summary Extraction

The system shall extract summaries from the first heading and paragraph of each document to include meaningful descriptions in the generated index.

#### Relations
  * containedBy: [Index Generator Implementation](#index-generator-implementation)

---

### Proper Link URL Generation

The system shall generate URLs in the index file with both Markdown (.md) and HTML (.html) extensions, ensuring documentation navigation works in both formats.

#### Relations
  * containedBy: [Index Generator Implementation](#index-generator-implementation)

---

### HTML Navigation Enhancement 

The system shall enhance the HTML generator to process index.md as a special file, adding navigation elements and ensuring it serves as the primary entry point.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Documentation Index HTML Integration](UserRequirements.html#documentation-index-html-integration)

---

### LLM Context Command

The system shall provide a command-line option `--llm-context` that outputs comprehensive contextual information about ReqFlow methodology, document structure, relation types, and CLI usage to help Large Language Models understand and work with ReqFlow-based projects.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/AI-Driven Model Suggestions](UserRequirements.html#ai-driven-model-suggestions)

---

### JSON Validation Output Format

The system shall provide validation results in machine-readable JSON format to facilitate integration with CI/CD pipelines and automated reporting tools.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserStories.md/Validating Structures](UserStories.html#validating-structures)

---

### Multiple Validation Modes Support

The system shall support different validation modes (validate_markdown, validate_relations, validate_all) with configurable behaviors to accommodate different use cases.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserStories.md/Validating Structures](UserStories.html#validating-structures)

---

### Interactive Mermaid Diagram Node Behavior

The system shall implement interactive click behavior for Mermaid diagram nodes that redirects to the referenced element when clicked.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Interactive Mermaid Diagrams](UserRequirements.html#interactive-mermaid-diagrams)

---

### Command Line Configuration Overrides

The system shall allow command line arguments to override YAML configuration settings to provide flexibility without modifying configuration files.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Project Configuration with YAML](UserRequirements.html#project-configuration-with-yaml)

---

### Design Specification Document Special Handling

The system shall provide special handling for Design Specification Documents when collecting elements to accommodate their unique structure and purpose.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserStories.md/Managing MBSE Models](UserStories.html#managing-mbse-models)

---

### Multi-Pass Linting Capability

The system shall support multi-pass linting with a configurable iteration limit to ensure all interdependent formatting issues are resolved.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Format Consistency Enforcement](UserRequirements.html#format-consistency-enforcement)

---

### Comprehensive HTML Generation

The system shall generate HTML output for all markdown files, not just requirements documents, to provide consistent representation of the entire model.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserStories.md/Managing MBSE Models](UserStories.html#managing-mbse-models)

---

### Detailed Error Handling and Logging

The system shall implement detailed error handling and logging throughout the application to facilitate troubleshooting and provide meaningful feedback.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Enhanced Validation Error Reporting](UserRequirements.html#enhanced-validation-error-reporting)

---

### Directory Structure Auto-Detection

The system shall automatically detect when running from within the specifications directory to adapt processing accordingly.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserRequirements.md/Validate Filesystem Structure](UserRequirements.html#validate-filesystem-structure)

---

### File Content Caching for Performance

The system shall cache file contents during processing to optimize performance for operations that require multiple passes through the same files.

#### Relations
  * refine: [UserStories.md/Managing MBSE Models](UserStories.html#managing-mbse-models)
