#### Details

Identification Process:

The process follows these steps to determine whether a file contains requirements and, if so, whether it falls under **Stakeholder Needs Requirements** or **System Requirements**:

1. **File Selection**: The process scans all files in the `specifications` folder (including subfolders) and `external_folders`.
2. **Excluded Patterns Check**: If a file matches any excluded patterns, it is marked as **not a requirements file**.
3. **File Extension Check**: If the file does not have a `.md` extension, it is marked as **not a requirements file**.
4. **Design Folder Check**: If the file is located in a folder defined by the `design_specifications_folder` configuration, it is marked as **not a requirements file**.
5. **External Folder Check**: If the file is found in an external folder (or any of its subfolders), it is categorized as a **System Requirements file**.
6. **Root Folder Check**: If the file is located at the root of the `specifications` folder, it is categorized as a **Stakeholder Needs Requirements file**. Otherwise, it is categorized as a **System Requirements file**.

#### Relations
  * satisfiedBy: [model.rs](https://github.com/reqflow/reqflow/src/model.rs)

## Categorization Outcomes
