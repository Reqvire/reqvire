##### Test Criteria
- Command exits with success (0) return code

- Both explicit and implicit git commit parameters work properly
- JSON output is valid and contains all necessary information
- GitHub-style blob URLs are included in the output

### CLI Git Commit Hash Flag Test

This test verifies that the system properly handles the git commit hash flag for change impact analysis.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification

#### Details

##### Acceptance Criteria
- System shall support --git-commit flag for change impact analysis
- System shall use specified commit hash as base for comparison
- System shall default to HEAD when flag is not specified
- System shall handle relative commit references (HEAD~1, etc.)

##### Test Criteria
- Command with explicit --git-commit flag runs successfully
- Command without flag defaults to HEAD commit
- Relative commit references are correctly resolved
- Invalid commit references are reported appropriately
- Change impact analysis correctly uses specified commit as baseline

##### Test Procedure
1. Create test fixtures with git repository containing multiple commits
2. Run Reqvire with --change-impact --git-commit=HEAD~1
3. Verify that the specified commit is used as baseline
4. Run Reqvire with --change-impact (no git-commit flag)
5. Verify that HEAD is used as default baseline
6. Run with invalid commit reference and verify appropriate error

#### Relations
  * verify: [SystemRequirements/Requirements.md#cli-git-commit-hash-flag](../SystemRequirements/Requirements.md#cli-git-commit-hash-flag)
  * trace: [tests/test-change-impact-detection/test.sh](../../tests/test-change-impact-detection/test.sh)

### Element Content Extraction Test

This test verifies that the system correctly extracts element content for change impact detection.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification

#### Details

##### Acceptance Criteria
- System should properly extract requirement body for change impact detection
- Requirement body should include normalized main text and content from the Details subsection
- System should handle requirements with various combinations of subsections

##### Test Criteria
- Command exits with success (0) return code
- Output shows expected content for each element
- Content extraction correctly handles different subsection ordering
- Content extraction properly handles HTML details tags

##### Test Procedure
1. Create test fixtures with requirements containing various combinations of subsections
2. Run Reqvire model summary on the test fixtures
3. Verify that extracted content matches expected content for each element
4. Verify that content from Details subsection is properly included

### Change Impact Smart Filtering Test

2. Add new parent requirement with derive relation to new child requirement
3. Add new child requirement with derivedFrom relation to parent
