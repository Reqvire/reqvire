# Design Specification Document: Requirements Change Impact Propagation

This document defines how requirements changes propagate through relationships within a Reqflow markdown based system model. 
It specifies how changes affect child requirements, parent requirements, verification artifacts, and related design elements, ensuring controlled and traceable impact analysis.

## Change Impact Propagation in Requirements

Requirements are interconnected through relations, and changes to a requirement may affect related requirements, verification methods, design specifications, or software components.

Changes propagate based on the relation type, which determines the impact direction and scope.

Changes to high-level requirements cascade down to implementation.
Verification artifacts must be marked for revalidation to reflect changes.
Automated tools should flag all impacted requirements for review.


## Relation Types and Change Propagation

The specific relation types, their directionality, and change propagation behaviors are defined in the [RelationTypesRegistry.md](RelationTypesRegistry.md) document, which serves as the single source of truth for all relation types in the system.

This document focuses on the implementation and mechanics of change propagation, while the registry defines the specific behaviors for each relation type.

### Relation Categories for Change Propagation

For change propagation purposes, relations can be categorized into several groups:

1. **Hierarchical Relations** - Changes propagate from parent to child elements (containedBy, contain, derivedFrom, derive, refine, refinedBy)
2. **Satisfaction Relations** - Changes to requirements affect implementations (satisfiedBy, satisfy)
3. **Verification Relations** - Changes to requirements invalidate verifications (verifiedBy, verify)
4. **Traceability Relations** - No change propagation, for documentation only (trace)

See the [RelationTypesRegistry.md](RelationTypesRegistry.md) document for the complete definition of each relation type, including its directionality and change propagation behavior.

## Change Propagation Mechanism

When a requirement changes, impact analysis must be conducted based on its relations. The following mechanism ensures traceability and controlled updates.

- Identify Impacted Relations
  - When a requirement is modified, check its Relations subsection to identify linked elements.
- Determine Change Propagation Scope
  - Apply the rules in Relation Types and Change Propagation Rules to assess whether the change affects child requirements, design artifacts, verification, or other linked documents.
- Invalidate Affected Elements
  - If a related element is impacted, flag it for review.  
  - Example: If a requirement verified by a test changes, the test must be reviewed.
- Require Re-validation or Re-design
  - If changes affect satisfaction (e.g., code or architecture), update the relevant design.  
  - If changes affect verification, update test cases or validation documents.
- If a change results in a requirement being merged, split, or removed, update its Relations to maintain traceability.


## Examples of Change Propagation


### Parent-Child Requirement Change

```markdown

---

### Parent Requirement
This requirement defines a high-level system constraint.

#### Relations
  * contain: [Child Requirement](#child-requirement)


---

### Child Requirement
This requirement defines additional functionality.

#### Relations
  * containedBy: [Parent Requirement](#parent-requirement)
  
```

If Parent Requirement changes, Child Requirement must be reviewed and updated.


---

### Requirement Satisfied by a Design Specification

```markdown

---

### Functional Requirement
The system shall process transactions within 500ms.

#### Relations
  * satisfiedBy: [architecture/system_design.md/Performance Constraints](architecture/system_design.md#performance-constraints)
```

If Functional Requirement changes, Performance Constraints in the architecture document must be updated.



---

### Requirement Verified by a Test

```

---

### Safety Requirement
The system shall shut down if temperature exceeds 100Â°C.

#### Relations
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/safety_verification.md/Overheat Shutdown Test](test_cases/safety_verification.md#overheat-shutdown-test)

```

If Safety Requirement changes, the Overheat Shutdown Test must be reviewed for update and executed again for verification.

### Example of Multi-Level Change Propagation in Requirements

The following analysis explains how a **change in the requirement**  propagates through multiple levels of related requirements, impacting their definitions, design artifacts, and verification processes.

---

```
### Root Requirement: System Power Management

The system shall implement power-saving mechanisms to optimize battery usage.  

---

### Power Saving Mode

The system shall activate power-saving mode when the battery level drops below 20%.  

#### Relations
  * refine: [System Power Management](#system-power-management)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/power_control.md](software/power_control.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/power_saving.md](test_cases/power_saving.md)

---

### CPU Power Reduction

The system shall reduce CPU frequency by 30% in power-saving mode.  

#### Relations
  * derivedFrom: [Power Saving Mode](#power-saving-mode)
  * satisfiedBy: [firmware/cpu_manager.md](firmware/cpu_manager.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/cpu_throttling.md](test_cases/cpu_throttling.md)

---

### Screen Brightness Adjustment

The system shall reduce screen brightness by 40% in power-saving mode.  

#### Relations
  * derivedFrom: [Power Saving Mode](#power-saving-mode)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/screen_brightness.md](test_cases/screen_brightness.md)

---

### Battery Optimization

The system shall disable non-essential background services when battery levels drop below 15%.  

#### Relations
  * derivedFrom: [System Power Management](#system-power-management)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/battery_manager.md](software/battery_manager.md)
  * verifiedBy: [test_cases/battery_saving.md](test_cases/battery_saving.md)

---

### Network Power Optimization
The system shall reduce network polling frequency when battery levels drop below 15%.  

#### Relations
  * derivedFrom: [Battery Optimization](#battery-optimization)
  * satisfiedBy: [software/network_manager.md](software/network_manager.md)
```

**Power Saving Mode** requirment has been changed to:
>The system shall activate power-saving mode when the battery level drops below 30%.


Change Propagation Flow:
1. A **change** in **Power Saving Mode** flows **downward** to **CPU Power Reduction** because it is **derivedFrom** it.
2. A **change** in **Power Saving Mode** flows **downward** to **Screen Brightness Adjustment** because it is **derivedFrom** it.    
3. Additionally, all **satisfiedBy** and **verifiedBy** relations from affected requirements must be reviewed:
   - **Power Saving Mode** â†’ **software/power_control.md** (implementation) & **test_cases/power_saving.md** (verification).  
   - **CPU Power Reduction** â†’ **firmware/cpu_manager.md** (implementation) & **test_cases/cpu_throttling.md** (verification).  
   - **Screen Brightness Adjustment** â†’ **[test_cases/screen_brightness.md** (verification).
