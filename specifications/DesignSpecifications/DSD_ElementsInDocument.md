# Design Specification Document: Structure and Addressing in Markdown Documents

This document defines the structure, rules, and usage of **Elements**, **Subsections** including **Relations**, and **Details**, as well as **Identifiers** in Markdown (`.md`) documents. 


## Elements

An **Element** is a uniquely identifiable section within a Markdown document and form the foundation of the modelâ€™s structure and relationships:

Elements may contain structured **Subsections**, each serving a specific purpose.

### Structure of an Element

1. **Element Header**
  - The `###` header defines the start of an element.
  - The text of the `###` header serves as the **element name**.
  - The element name must be unique within the same document to ensure unambiguous references.

2. **Element Content**
  - The element includes all content under the `###` header until:
    - The next `###` header, or
    - A higher-level header (`##`, `#`), or
    - The end of the document.
  - The content can include:
    - Text
    - Subheaders (e.g., `####`) representing a start of subsection.
    - Bullet points, code blocks, tables, etc.


## Rules for Elements

1. **Header Format**:
   - An element must start with a `###` header.
   - The `###` header text must not be empty.

2. **Uniqueness**:
   - Element names must be unique within the same file.
 
3. **Nested Subheaders**:
   - Subheaders within an element (e.g., `####`) are part of the same element and do not create new elements.

4. **No Overlapping Content**:
   - Content in an element belongs exclusively to that element and cannot overlap with another.


### Examples of Elements

Single Element:
```markdown
### My Element

This is the content of My Element.

#### Subsection
Additional details about My Element.
```

Multiple Elements:
```
### Element One

This is the content of Element One.

### Element Two

This is the content of Element Two.
```

Nested Subheaders:
```
### Main Element
This is the main element content.

#### Subsection
Details about the subsection.

#### Another Subsection
More details about another subsection.
```

### Invalid Cases

Element headers not empty:
```
###
```

Headers not unique within the same document:
```
### Duplicate
Content of the first duplicate.

### Duplicate
Content of the second duplicate.
```

## Identifiers

The **identifier** is represented as a path following a filename with extension (eg file.md) and optionally an **element** name.
Identifier path if starting with '/' is considered starting from a 'specification' folder.
If path doesn't not start with the '/', it is considered **relative** to a path of the document itself.


Each **identifier** must uniquely reference either:
  * A file, or
  * An element within a file.


Examples of Identifiers:
  - When **specifications** root folder is : `/path/to/project`
  - And a file path: `/path/to/project/documents/File1.md`
  - Identifiers in the document would resolve to:
    - 'File2.md' -> path/to/project/documents/File2.md'
    - 'subfolder/File3.md' -> path/to/project/documents/subfolder/File3.md'    
    - '/File4.md' -> '/path/to/project/File4.md'
    - '../File4.md' -> '/path/to/project/File4.md'    

Other Examples of Identifiers:
 * Relative path with element fragment: 'relative_path/file.md/element name'.
 * File with element fragment: 'file.md/element name'.
 * File only: 'file.md'.
 * Element name fragment only: 'element name'.
 * Element fragment with special characters: 'path/file.md/My Element (Draft)'


##  Subsections

An element may contain different **Subsections**, some of which are strictly defined, while others allow free-form content.
- **Reserved Subsections**: These subsections follow a predefined structure.
- **Other Subsections**: These allow additional descriptive or supporting information.

Subsections starts with the `#### Subsection Name` and ends either with new element or next subsection.

The reserved subsections are:
 * Relations
 * Details
 * Properties
 * Metadata
 
Those have defines structure that must be followed.

### Details Subsection

The **#### Details** subsection within an element provides additional information directly related to the main requirement text.

- Content within the **Details** subsection is considered an **extension of the requirement text**.
- Any statements in the **Details** subsection hold the same validity as the main requirement text.

###  Relations Subsection

The `#### Relations` subsection specifies associations between elements, files, or other resources, forming the logical and dependency structure of the model.

- Relations must follow a **structured reference format** to ensure clear traceability.
- Supported relation types include (but are not limited to):
  - `refine:` (further elaborates on another element)
  - `verifiedBy:` (links to test or validation resources)
  - `dependsOn:` (establishes dependency on another requirement or component)


`#### Relations` contains a list of relations in a specific format.

The `#### Relations` subsection must be located within an element chunk.
Each element chunk can have at most one `#### Relations` subsection.

The `#### Relations` header marks the beginning of the subsection.

The `#### Relations` subsection must appear directly within an element  chunk.
It must follow the `###` header of the parent element and any preceding content including previous subsections.

Relation entries are listed as bullet points (`*`) with 2 spaces '  *' indentation from the beginning of the line, and follow this format:
 * relationType: **identifier**

**relationType**:
 - Specifies the type of the relationship.
 - Allowed characters are [a-zA-z].
 - Min 2 characters and Max 80 characters.

**identifier**:
 - Specifies the target of the relation.
 - For the details see **identifier** specification.

Duplicate relation entries within the same `#### Relations` subsection are not allowed.


#### Examples of `#### Relations`

Simple Relations:
```markdown
### My Element
This is the content of My Element.

#### Relations
  * dependsOn: [Element2](#element2)
  * relatedTo: [path/to/anotherFile.md/Section3](path/to/anotherFile.html#section3)
  * uses: [file.md](file.html)
```

Relations with Special Characters:
```
### Complex Element
This is the content of a complex element.

#### Relations
  * dependsOn: [Element (Alpha & Beta)](#element-(alpha-&-beta))
  * relatedTo: [path/to/special File.md/Section (Draft)](path/to/special File.html#section-(draft))
```

Invalid Entries:
```
### Invalid Relations Example
This element contains invalid relation entries.

#### Relations
  * dependsOn: [Element2](#element2)
* InvalidEntry
* : MissingRelationType
  * relatedTo: [path/to/file.md](path/to/file.html)
```



### Identifier Usage in Relations

Identifiers are used in relations to reference files or specific elements within files. Examples:

1. **Relation to a File**:
   ```markdown
   #### Relations
  * satisfiedBy: [documents/specification.md](documents/specification.html)
   ```
    
2. **Relation to an Element**:
   ```markdown
   #### Relations
  * dependsOn: [documents/specification.md/section one](documents/specification.html#section-one)
   ```
