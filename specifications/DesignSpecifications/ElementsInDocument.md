# Design Specification Document: Structure and Addressing in Markdown Documents

This document defines the structure, rules, and usage of **Elements**, **Subsections** including **Relations**, and **Details**, as well as **Identifiers** in Markdown (`.md`) documents. 


## Elements

An **Element** is a uniquely identifiable section within a Markdown document and form the foundation of the modelâ€™s structure and relationships:

Elements may contain structured **Subsections**, each serving a specific purpose.

### Structure of an Element

1. **Element Header**
  - The `###` header defines the start of an element.
  - The text of the `###` header serves as the **element name**.
  - The element name must be unique within the same document to ensure unambiguous references.

2. **Element Content**
  - The element includes all content under the `###` header until:
    - The next `###` header, or
    - A higher-level header (`##`, `#`), or
    - The end of the document.
  - The content can include:
    - Text
    - Subheaders (e.g., `####`) representing a start of subsection.
    - Bullet points, code blocks, tables, etc.


## Rules for Elements

1. **Header Format**:
   - An element must start with a `###` header.
   - The `###` header text must not be empty.

2. **Uniqueness**:
   - Element names must be unique within the same file.
 
3. **Nested Subheaders**:
   - Subheaders within an element (e.g., `####`) are part of the same element and do not create new elements.

4. **No Overlapping Content**:
   - Content in an element belongs exclusively to that element and cannot overlap with another.

5. **Allowed Characters**
   - **Letters**: `a-z`, `A-Z`
   - **Numbers**: `0-9`
   - **Spaces**: ` `
   - **Special characters allowed**: `-`, `_`, `.` (hyphen, underscore, and period)


### Examples of Elements

Single Element:
```markdown
### My Element

This is the content of My Element.

#### Subsection
Additional details about My Element.
```

Multiple Elements:
```
### Element One

This is the content of Element One.

### Element Two

This is the content of Element Two.
```

Nested Subheaders:
```
### Main Element
This is the main element content.

#### Subsection
Details about the subsection.

#### Another Subsection
More details about another subsection.
```

### Invalid Cases

Element headers not empty:
```
###
```

Headers not unique within the same document:
```
### Duplicate
Content of the first duplicate.

### Duplicate
Content of the second duplicate.
```

## Identifiers

See more in design specification document [DSD_RepresentationOfIdentifiersAndRelations.md](DSD_RepresentationOfIdentifiersAndRelations.md).

##  Subsections

An element may contain different **Subsections**, some of which are strictly defined, while others allow free-form content.
- **Reserved Subsections**: These subsections follow a predefined structure.
- **Other Subsections**: These allow additional descriptive or supporting information.

Subsections starts with the `#### Subsection Name` and ends either with new element or next subsection.
Subsection must be located **within an element chunk**.
The `#### ` header marks the beginning of the subsection.
It must appear directly within an element chunk, **following** the `###` header of the parent element and any preceding content, including previous subsections.
Each element chunk can have **at most one** `#### SubsectionName` subsection where 'SubsectionName' is a unique name of the subsection within an element.

The reserved subsections are:
 * Relations
 * Details
 * Properties
 * Metadata
 
Those have defines structure that must be followed.

### Details Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Details`.

The **#### Details** subsection within an element provides additional information directly related to the main requirement text.

- Content within the **Details** subsection is considered an **extension of the requirement text**.
- Any statements in the **Details** subsection hold the same validity as the main requirement text.

###  Relations Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Relations`.

Duplicate relation entries within the same `#### Relations` subsection are not allowed.

See more in design specification document [DSD_RepresentationOfIdentifiersAndRelations.md](DSD_RepresentationOfIdentifiersAndRelations.md).

### Metadata Subsection

Must be defined with a level 4 header: `#### Metadata`.

The metadata section of an element follows these rules:
1. Contains properties in list format: `* property_name: property_value`
2. Property entries are listed as bullet points (`*`), with **two spaces** (`  *`) of indentation followed by property_name + ': ' + property_value.
3. May include any custom properties, not just `type`

#### Reserved Properties

The following properties have special meaning:

- `type`: Defines the element type (requirement, verification, etc.)
- Additional reserved properties may be defined in future releases

#### Example Metadata Section

```markdown
### My Element

This is a verification element.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification
  * priority: high
  * owner: team-a

#### Relations
* verifies: [Some Requirement](#some-requirement)
```

```markdown
### My Element

This is a verification element.

#### Details

Some details.

#### Metadata
  * type: verification
  * priority: high
  * owner: team-a

#### Relations
  * verifies: [Some Requirement](#some-requirement)
```

#### Metadata Parsing

When parsing elements from Markdown:
1. The parser identifies `#### Metadata` sections within elements
2. Properties are extracted from list items following the metadata header
3. The element type is set based on the metadata "type" property if present otherwise defaults to a **requirement** type.
4. All metadata is stored for potential future use.


Elements types are defined in a **#### Metadata**  **subsection** within an **element** as a **type** property and value, see more for structure of elements in  [ElementsInDocument.md](ElementsInDocument.md).

### Element Types in Metadata Section

#### Supported Element Types

Element types are identified through a reserved "type" metadata property. The following types are supported:

1. **requirement**: The default element type when no type is specified
2. **verification**: For verification tests and validation procedures
3. **other**: Custom element types defined by users

#### Type Determination

The type of an element is determined through the following process:

1. If a `#### Metadata` subsection exists and includes a `type` property, use that value
2. If no type is specified, default to `Requirement`
3. Future versions may add more built-in types as needed
