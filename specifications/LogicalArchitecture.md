### Explanation of the Diagram

1. ReqFlow:
   - Serves as the overarching logical system, encompassing all key components that deliver the toolâ€™s core functionalities.

2. RequirementManagement:
   - Responsible for validating the structure of requirements to ensure compliance with conventions and rules defined in the methodology.

3. DiagramGeneration:
   - Handles the creation of visual representations, such as use case diagrams and traceability matrices, using Mermaid syntax from structured Markdown files.

4. Traceability:
   - Ensures relationships between requirements and other artifacts are maintained. It includes functionality for linking requirements, generating impact reports, and managing changes through Git diffs.

5. CICDIntegration:
   - Focuses on automating processes within CI/CD pipelines, providing GitHub workflows for tasks like validation and diagram generation. Additionally, it supports managing isssues, comments and PRs.
