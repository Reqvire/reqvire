### Explanation of Use Cases


1. Generate Diagrams:
   - Automatically create diagrams, such as use case diagrams or traceability matrices, using Mermaid syntax from structured Markdown files.

2. Validate Markdown Structure:
   - Ensure that the Markdown files adhere to the defined conventions for requirements, relations, and documentation.

3. Generate Traceability Matrix:
   - Produce a matrix linking requirements to related artifacts like test cases, design specifications, and constraints.

4. Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines:
   - Use GitActions or other CI/CD tools to automate tasks such as validation, diagram generation, and traceability matrix updates.

5. Automate Requirement Checks:
   - Automatically verify the consistency of requirements, their relations, and compliance during CI/CD pipeline execution.

6. Trace Changes in Requirements:
   - Changes are traced through Git diffs, leveraging defined relationships to generate summary reports and highlight the impact of changes on downstream artifacts.
