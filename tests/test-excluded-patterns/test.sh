# Test: Excluded Patterns Functionality
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Acceptance Criteria:
# - Files matching excluded_filename_patterns should not be processed for validation
# - Files matching excluded_filename_patterns should only be tracked for relation targets
# - Only relations TO excluded files should be valid, not relations FROM excluded files
#
# Test Criteria:
# - Command should not validate elements within files matching excluded patterns
# - Elements in excluded files should not be in registry for direct access
# - Only the file itself should be in the registry for relation validation

# There should be no errors about excluded file relations being invalid

# There should also be no elements from excluded files in the registry

# Now exit with the actual test result (success or failure)
