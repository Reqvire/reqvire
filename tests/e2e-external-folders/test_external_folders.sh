# Test: External Folders Support
# -----------------------------
# Acceptance Criteria:
# - System should process requirements in external folders
# - System should treat external requirements as system requirements
# - User Requirements in external folders should cause validation errors
#
# Test Criteria:
# - Validation succeeds with proper external folder setup
# - Validation fails when external folder contains user requirements
# - Diagram generation includes external folder requirements
#
# Test Implementation for Verification:
# - See: specifications/Verifications/LintingTests.md
